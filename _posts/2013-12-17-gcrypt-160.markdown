title: "Libgcrypt 1.6.0 released"
---

Yesterday Werner Koch has tagged the 1.6.0 release of Libgcrypt.

What does that mean for us? All required algorithms are in place. For some of them we just miss proper curves declarations.
For some of them there will be an gcry\_control call to select proper S-box.

Another important milestone --- with slightly patched Libgcrypt and my local GnuTLS library I got 'pass' marks in most of the test suite in GnuTLS. There are still few tests failing, but hopefully I can fix them soon. That would mean that I can start working on bringing GOST keys support to GnuTLS.
